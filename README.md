## How it works

More coming soon...

## Example

Take a look at the examples folder, it has a nodejs application which provides the minimum level of functionality, as
well as an html file which shows what you need to do to instantiate one of these components.

There's an online version of the example: [here](http://itemlistexample.apphb.com/index.html)

Hover over an item and click the "x" that appears to remove it.
Click "Add Activity", to add a new item.
Forgive the ugly styling of the demo, it was produced very quickly, and hence rather dirtily.
